# Refactoring by Martin Fowler 2nd Edition

## Why
I want to becoming a proficient programmer. One sure fired way to get there is to be able to read other people's code.

It took me a long time to realize, not all people write good code.

## Layout

- The master branch will contain the starting codebase

- Each chapter has its own directory, consisting of starting files and notes.md

- each additional branch will contain a single refactoring with commits denoting each change

- the final branch will attempt to apply the refactoring methods learned to a generative art example

- the notes.md will be updated with learnings along the way

## TO DO
- [x] Martin advocates for tests aka `red green refactor`, so I'll need to write tests.
