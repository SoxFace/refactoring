# Refactoring by Martin Fowler 2nd Edition

`any person can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand`

## Why
I want to transition from being an amazing tutorial follower to a proficient programmer. One sure fired way to get there is to be able to read other people's code and improve upon it. It took me a long time to realize, not all people write readable code. 

Ergo, learning how to refactor and seems like a very good place to start.

## Layout

- The master branch will contain the starting codebase

- Each chapter has its own directory, consisting of starting files and notes.md

- Each additional branch will contain a single refactoring with commits denoting each change

- The final branch will attempt to apply the refactoring methods learned to a generative art example

- The NOTES.md will be updated with learnings along the way

## TO DO
- [x] Martin advocates for tests aka `red green refactor`, so I'll need to write tests.
