# Refactoring by Martin Fowler 2nd Edition

## Why
I want to becoming a proficient programmer. One sure fired way to get there is to be able to read other peoples' code.

It took me a long time to realize, that not all people write good code.

## Layout

- Each chapter has its own directory, consisting of starting files and notes.md

- The master branch will contain the starting codebase

- each additional branch will contain a single refactor step with commits denoting each change

- the final branch will attempt to apply the refactoring methods learned to a generative art example

- the notes.md will be updated with learnings along the way

## TO DO
Martin advocates for tests aka `red green refactor`, so I'll need to write tests. 

Ideally, I'd start with tests first. 

I don't yet have the confidence to do so [2 Jan 2019] - I may have to enlist the help of others to help get me started on this.
